### Explanation

Preset 1 was interesting to me because it scaled down the simulation and created many tiny circular pockets, while otherwise being very saturated. To me, it looks like a bacteria or mold formation.

Preset 2 looks a little like stars to me. In this preset, the cells all collect into little circles that separate from each other. Additionally, the blue color reminds me of the sky.

Preset 3 is interesting because the simulation looks like it is swirling around on itself. It reminds me of paisley patterns, and I also think that the red gaussian blur combined with the purple/yellow main cell color creates for a very cool effect.

Preset 4 cannot be shown in a picture. It can be added onto any other preset or modification and essentially freezes the simulation. When the preset is chosen, the simulation stops at exactly where it is (with the exception of the rainbow color changes). I thought it was really interesting that when the sensor angle and rotate angle were both exactly pi, the simulation will completely stop moving.
