### Explanation
Technically,..
I used a random generator to create sparse twinkling stars in the background as well.

Aesthetically, I wanted to go for a night sky. I used purple, blue, and green colors on a dark background to replicate the northern lights. Additionally, the sky would slowly transition from light to dark and back to indicate day and night cycles. The background has twinkling stars that I aimed not to detract from the lights themselves. I also created moving lights in the middle that look to me like starships, which align with my theme of the sky and space.

### Feedback

I received feedback from Karen. Her first impression was that it looked like a galaxy, and she thought it was very glowy. She enjoyed that it looked like space as well as the addition of the alien ships in the middle, which she said looked like people trying to travel. In general, her feedback aligns with my original goals for this project.
